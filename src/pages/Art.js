                  Hey Jess! I saw that we're in the same guild, and I was
                  wondering if you wanted to do some Guild Wars missions with
                  me? I know you're new to the game, so I thought it'd be fun to
                  show you the best events in town.

                  Hi :). That sounds fun. I'm already logged in, so I'll just
                  join your party.

                    they have an awesome new update - dinosaurs and things, man!

                    you sure that's a thing? Sounds like fake news... I can't
                    come on today though :(... Got a new assignment that's
                    killllling me!

                    Awh! Sorry. I didn't realise you were still studying. How
                    are things that side of the world? Are you still studying
                    at... Wits, was it?

                    Yeah! Haha. I can't believe you remember the name of my
                    university. Things are alright, just a bit stressful this
                    time of year, but the weather has been absolutely amazing!

                    South Africa in summer looks suppperrr nice. I wish I could
                    fly right over, but my parents would probably kill me! You
                    must make sure to keep your promise and show me to all the
                    local secrets when I sneak over there. I'll let you get back
                    to your assignments then. Let me know if you can play later!

                    Super proud of myself though, not going to lie. It took so
                    many hours just to get enough wood to make it look like a
                    tree ;-;. And then I had to try make a random pattern and
                    everything! What a project.

                    That's amazing, bud! Hop onto Discors, and let's discuss! We
                    should do a Red Bus Tour so you can get a look at everything
                    in Cape Town! Also, I need help with this Valheim boss :(,
                    so can we play too?

                    Thank you! I had such a lovely time with you! Exploring
                    Kirstenbosch was so nice, and The Red Bus Tour was extremely
                    informative, but I surprsied that even you didn't know half
