            This essay will analyse the internet artworks created by the Twitter
            bot @mothgenerator. This will be done by categorising the type of
            internet artwork the bot makes, analysing the works itself, and the
            way in which the Twitter (and hence the internet) is used as a
            medium. It will briefly comment on artificially generated art and
            will suggest ways in which this internet artwork could be archived.{" "}

            @mothgenerator is a Twitter bot who was created by Loren Schmidt and
            Katie Rose Pipkin. It posts imaginary moths with names which are
            derived from scientific names in Latin and English. Additionally, it
            allows for user interaction, and can be tagged in Tweets with random
            words or phrases to generate a custom moth for the user.
            @mothgenerator currently has around 10 900 followers and was created
            in 2015.{" "}

            According to Danae (2019), internet art (net art) is characterised
            by its use of digital technologies, interactivity, and networked
            communication; often exploring issues related to identity, politics,
            and technology, and is created for and distributed through the
            internet. This makes the works created @mothgenerator a good example
            of internet art within this definition. The works are created by an
            algorithm and are then posted and share on the social media platform
            Twitter. Additionally, users can interact with the bot and acquire a
            unique work for themselves. Anton G. (2022) elaborates further on
            internet art and suggests various aspects of sub-categories. In
            particular he speaks about algorithmic art, and defines it as an art
            which is generative and uses autonomous programs or algorithms to
            create art pieces. Once again, this is a sub-category in which
            @mothgenerator fits because it is an algorithm which procedurally
            generates moths and names for the moths.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            @mothgenerator’s works are aesthetically pleasing. It makes use of
            symmetry to balance its images, and a variety of colours and shapes
            to make whimsical imaginary moths. The combination of the accents,
            colours, shapes and sizes used to create unique images makes the
            variety of species much broader, but the uniqueness of each image
            keeps the audience engaged because they would want to see the next
            creations. Technically speaking, @mothgenerator makes use of genetic
            algorithms to generate its own images, and is capable of evolving
            over time. Its ability to create unique works, and post them on
            Twitter without human intervention is an impressive feat, and is a
            good example of a self-sustaining system. @mothgenerator is hosted
            on the social media platform Twitter, and hence its artworks (as
            posts) are affected by the affordances and limitations of the
            platform. David Carrier (2020) makes a few arguments about the
            effects of social media on art. For example, social media allows
            artists to gain more exposure by being able to reach a broader
            audience, and allows for more people to engage with artworks
            regardless of social status. Additionally, because of the way in
            which one’s interaction with artworks has changed (one can now
            experience them through phones), the perception and experience of
            them has also been changed. @mothgenerator experiences all of these
            effects. Its posts can reach a variety of users because of Twitter’s
            algorithm, users can easily interact with @mothgenerator by tagging
            it in their posts and receive a unique moth, and @mothgenerator
            feels more accessible and easier to engage with because users are
            able to connect with it through their devices, and are not limited
            to only being able to engage with it at a specific time or place.
            Whilst these aspects are good, there are also aspects which are not
            good about the effects of social media on art. For example, because
            art has become so accessible, the focus of artworks has shifted
            towards shareability. Additionally, because more people can make
            art, the quality of the works has decreased, and the surge of
            mediocre works makes it difficult for brilliant works to be
            discovered. Whilst it does not seem that these effects have affected
            @mothgenerator, it is still disadvantageous for artwork on social
            media.

          <p>
            Due to the nature of @mothgenerator, it is situated within the
            discourses of artificially generated artworks. Within this
            discourse, there are two camps of people: those who support
            artificially generated artworks, and those who do not. Artificially
            generated art is procedurally generated, and this means that the
            program would need a database of human made assets with which it can
            make artworks. For those who do not support artificial intelligence
            (AI) making art, this is one of the key arguments against it because
            it concerns using all available images on the internet without the
            consent of the artists. Furthermore, these artists are not
            compensated with their works being used, and copyright laws are not
            useful in regulating this. On the other hand, those who do support
            AI art would argue that it improves accessibility to art because
            anyone can use these programs to make art. Additionally, this art is
            available to everyone free of cost to the user. AI has changed the
            way in which people create art, however, it does call into question
            the role of the artist in automated artworks. @mothgenerator can
            create original images without the intervention of humans, however,
            I would argue that the art is not the image, but instead the program
            itself. This is because without the program, the art would not
            exist. Smee (2023), would argue against this and say that the images
            and the program are both elements of the same artwork. In his
            article AI is no threat to traditional artists. But it is thrilling,
            he uses artist Refik Anadol to explore the dynamics between chance
            from the program and control from the human artist. Although the
            program is able to make a randomised image from its database, it is
            only though the human prompt of interaction that it is able to
            change and create something. This is best shown in Anadol’s work
            Unsupervised which is used as an example within Smee’s 2023 article.

            One of the challenges of internet art, or digital art, is the
            ability to archive it. For example, how does one verify that the
            digital artwork they received is the original or at least authentic
            artwork? This is usually achieved through proper record keeping, and
            by ensuring that there is only one copy of the artwork at a time.
            Sometimes this is mimicked, and only one copy of the artwork can be
            displayed at a time. Another example of a challenge would be the
            increased obsolescence of the technology over time. For example,
            some artworks are constrained to being on a certain program or on a
            certain piece of hardware. Whilst there is no easy solution to this,
            archiving organisations have to keep updating the artwork so it is
            able to function on newer technologies, or keep the obsolete
            hardware/software to run the artwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, @mothgenerator can be considered a piece of internet
            art in the sub-category algorithmic art as outlined by Danae (2019),
            and Anton (2022). It is an AI program which creates images that
            makes use of various colours, shapes, sizes and accents to create
            unique images, and it is able to create and post these unique images
            without human intervention; it is self-sustaining. @mothgenerator’s
            works are subjected to the platform it is hosted on, and this comes
            with both affordances and limitations. Twitter posts are able to
            reach broad audiences, facilitate engagement, and change the
            perspective or experience of the artworks through the use of digital
            devices. However, the posts are also subjected to a decreased
            interest because of lack of shareability, and a shifted need of
            quantity over quality. @mothgenerator is situated within the
            discourses around artificial intelligence (AI) and art because it is
            an artificial program that makes artworks. This discourse has two
            camps of people: those opposed to AI art, and those who agree with
            it. Those we are opposed to it, are concerned about copyright laws,
            and the stealing of artworks without credit or compensation, and
            those who agree with it are impressed by its accessibility and
            affordability in comparison to traditional artworks. Additionally,
            those who agree with AI art, are interested with the tension between
            the randomness the program creates, and the control of the prompt or
            interaction by the human. One of the issues relating to internet
            art, is the archiving of these artworks. These artworks are hosted
            on platforms or technologies which are not necessarily suited
            towards preservation, and this calls for archiving organisations to
            make solutions for this new type of work. Additionally, this calls
            into question the authenticity of a work, and how to reduce the
            number of copies to mimic a sense of singularity.
